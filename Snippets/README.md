# Snippets

Snippets within SAS Studio enable you to create code templates for common tasks that you reuse all the time - or maybe it is just a memory helper for that one thing you rarely use and always have to search up.

More about snippets can be found in the [SAS documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/webeditorcdc/default/webeditorug/n002bgjjez3z63n16y88kjsobrha.htm).

You can download these snippets and upload them via the Sinppets pane and clicking the Upload snippets to My Snippets button - more on this can be found in the [SAS documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/webeditorcdc/default/webeditorug/n002bgjjez3z63n16y88kjsobrha.htm#p1uiir9yi0bqojn110shb2ht045v).

## Workspace Snippets

Here you can find snippets that are related to the [workspace](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/webeditorcdc/default/webeditorug/n0uc8cc3mvz0o2n101l56nb8x7t8.htm) feature in SAS Studio:

- [Project Link Creator](./Project%20Link%20Creator.csm), utilizing the abbreviation @plc this snippet creates a code template to create a deeplink into SAS Studio that opens up a new session with a specified workspace file and compute context.
- [Workspace Template](./Workspace%20Template.csm), utilizing the abbreviation @wst this snippet creates a JSON template for you to fill in for a new workspace file - yes snippets can also be used within .workspace files.
